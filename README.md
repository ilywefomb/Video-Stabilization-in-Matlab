# Video-Stabilization-in-Matlab

This program uses the method of video stabilization presented in the paper:
research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/yasumat/fullframe_cvpr05.pdf
Without the motion smoothing and motion inpainting part. 

This program also uses the open source libraries available on Matlab FileExchange to calculate the optical flow values. 

The script main.m is initializer file. Open main.m in matlab and change the input to the function vstabilize('input video path') to get the stabilized output.
